    "## **Team Members**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mähönen Janne**: Worked on text-to-speech (TTS), translation, and summary types integration.\n",
    "- **Ocampo Heidi**: [Brief description of your role and contribution].\n",
    "- **Sillanaukee Joonas**: [Brief description of your role and contribution].\n",
    "- **Silvola Izabel**: [Brief description of your role and contribution].\n",

    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Provide a brief summary of the project's main goal.\n",
    "- **Key Tools**: Highlight the primary models/tools used (e.g., _BART for summarization, deep_translator for translation, gTTS for text-to-speech_).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the overall design of the application or project.\n",
    "- Include any wireframes, flowcharts, or UI design considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Challenges (Izabel)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outline the main challenges faced during the project (e.g., scheduling meetings, coordinating different programming levels, etc.).\n",
    "- Discuss how these challenges were addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote communication and lack of face-to-face interaction:**\n",
    "One of the challenges we faced was working remotely, which made communication through Teams more difficult at times. Without face-to-face interaction, it was harder to have quick, spontaneous conversations to solve problems or brainstorm ideas.\n",
    "Scheduling meetings was also a challenge, as part of the group have other responsibilities to manage, making it tough to find time that worked for the whole team. Plus, without being able to pick up on non-verbal cues, it was sometimes tricky to fully understand tone or intent during discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Varied programming skill levels and educational backgrounds:**\n",
    "Another challenge we encountered was the difference in programming skills and educational backgrounds within the team. Some members had more experience with certain tools and technologies, while others were still learning or came from different academic programs with varying focuses. This created a bit of a learning curve for some team members and sometimes slowed down progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrating features developed separately:**\n",
    "We developed each new feature individually and then tried to combine them later, which turned out to be a challenge. While programming features one at a time helped us focus on each aspect, integrating them into a single system was more complex than expected. There were unexpected compatibility issues between the different components, and combining everything required more troubleshooting and coordination than we initially anticipated. This made the integration phase more difficult than planned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Code Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide a brief overview of the code structure and logic.\n",
    "- Mention any key algorithms or functions used in the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Future Improvements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suggest areas for improvement or potential features to be added in future versions.\n",
    "- Discuss how these improvements could enhance the project's functionality or usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. In Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize the main points discussed in the presentation.\n",
    "- Reflect on the learning experiences and outcomes of the project.\n",
    "\n",
